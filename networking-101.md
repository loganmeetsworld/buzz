### Berkeley Sockets API
First implementation of the TCP. You can use sockets without having to know the details of this underlying protocol.

### TCP/UDP 
Both TCP and UDP are protocols used for sending bits of data. They both build on top of the Internet protocol.  These packets are treated similarly, as theyâ€™re forwarded from your computer to intermediary routers and on to the destination.

### TCP 
Transmission Control Protocol. TCP is an algorithm where you send data in packets.

## ICMP
Internet control message protocol

### netcat
Unix utility for creating TCP (and UDP) connections and listens. Useful to work with sockets. 

### UDP  
User Datagram Protocol, connectionless transmission model w/ a minimum protocol mechanism, doesn't confirm if sent, usually in contrast to TCP, used by DNS

### EMFILE  
A process is trying to open too many files. Unix systems have a max number of file descriptors they can be assigned. The EMFILE error is thrown when too many of these are open

### Protocol  
Think rules and regulations. A set of rules and standards that define a language that devices can use to talk to one another. There are a great number of protocols in use extensively in networking, and they are often implemented in different layers.

### CIDR Blocks  
Classless Inter-Domain Routing. This is a method for allocating IP addresses
and routing IP packets. It is a way of allowing flexible allocation of IPs and
made the number of IPs much more. So the blocks are blocks of IPs. 

### TCP  
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP). 

## VPN 
VPN stands for virtual private network. It is a means of connecting separate LANs through the internet, while maintaining privacy. This is used as a means of connecting remote systems as if they were on a local network, often for security reasons.

## LAN 
LAN stands for "local area network". It refers to a network or a portion of a network that is not publicly accessible to the greater internet. A home or office network is an example of a LAN.

## Media Access Control 
Communications protocol for distinguishing specific devices. 

## OSI
Open Systems Interconnect, seven separate layers

## Media Access Control
Communications protocol that is used to distinguish specific devices.

## Service Discovery
If you are writing code that invokes a service that has a REST API, your code needs to know the network location (IP address and port) of a service instance. In a traditional application running on hardware, the network locations of service instances are more static. 

## FPGA
A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing.
