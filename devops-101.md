### filesystem
A filesystem is the street grid of your hard drive. Itâ€™s a map of addresses to where data is located on your drive. Your operating system uses the filesystem to store data on the drive. - Ops School

### #serverless/#noops  
A movement moving towards abstracting users away from servers, infrastructure, and having to deal with configuration. Now we can use so many single purpose services (s3 for storage, lambda for compute platforms executing code). By composing and combining a ton of these services together loosely we can build complex systems like the ones we had before. Caveat being that now you have 50 services and have to teach people to use 50 services.

### ELK  
Elasticsearch (ES) -->  Logstash --> Kibana. 

### soft vs hard interrupts  
A hardware interrupt is issed by hardware devices (disk, network cards, keyboards, etc.). Each device has a IRQ (Interrupt Reqest) line. Based on the IRQ, the CPU will dsipatch the request to the hardware driver. Hardware interrupts the CPU _directly_. It causes releant code in a kernel to be triggered. Software interrupts are similarly processed but can only be generated by processes _currently_ running. They are typically requests for input or output and talk to the kernel. Then it is the responsibility of the kernel to schedule any processes which need to run. This doesn't directly interrupt the CPU. 

### ksoftirqd  
per-cpu kernel thread running when the machine is under soft-interupt load. Soft interrpts are serviced on return from a _hard_ interrupt. When ksoftirq is taking more than a tiny percentage of CPU time, this indicates the machine is under heavy soft interrupt load.

### Syscall  
Systems call or kernel call. It is a request in a Unix-like OS made via a software interrupt by an active process for a service performed by the kernel.
