### Mutex  
Short for Mutual Exclussion. A program object that allows multiple program threads to share the same resource such as file access, but not simultaneously. It is a property of concurrency control which prevents race conditions (i.e. two things that happen at once and compete for space/time). It requires that one thread of execution never enter critical state at same time as another.
